# Prerequisites

This project requires you to use the Java JDK Version 18. \
Please select the appropriate JDK in the IntelliJ project settings.

You'll need a Docker container running **PostgreSQL** on port 5432.
If you have not already, you can set up such a docker container using the command:

`docker run --name postgres-db -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres`

The username and password are assumed to be both "postgres".
You can change the username and password that hibernate uses in application.properties.

# Setup

Open the application in IntelliJ. you should be able to execute the application after IntelliJ has finished indexing all the files and building the gradle project.
Build & Run the application (e.g. by running the bootRun Gradle task).

the application should start and run now. You should see a message similar to this at the end of a long console log:\
`2021-09-14 14:31:15.056 INFO 27988 --- [ main] com.example.demo.DemoApplication : Started DemoApplication in 4.122 seconds (JVM running for 4.991)`

If you've set up the project correctly you should be able to access the endpoint `http://localhost:3000/` after logging in with the following user: \
email: **admin@example.com** (admin) \
password: **1234** \
email: **user@example.com** (normal user) \
password: **1234**



# Common Issues & Fixes 

- Restart the PostGreSQL container & check the container is running
- Confirm connection to the DB (e.g. in DBeaver)
- Restart IntelliJ & your Spring Boot application

# Hints

- You can add mock data to your database on startup using an SQL script named `data.sql` placed in the resources folder
- You can execute statements at startup by adding them to `AppStartupRunner.run()`

# Testing

We tested our application with **Cypress & Postman**.  
To run the tests, you need to have the application running on localhost:3000. \
Then you can run the Cypress tests with the command `npx cypress open` in the frontend terminal. \
For the Postman tests, you can import the collection from the Postman folder **(backend/src/test/postman)** and run the tests. \
**You need to restart the backend  every time after running the collection, because it changes the data**
## Cypress Tests
Our Cypress tests cover the following use cases: 
* Only Admin can go to the the admin page (/admin) 
* Only Admin can create, edit & delete a group 
* normal user can only see the group details, where the user is part of and admin has access to all group details 


## Postman Tests
Our Postman tests cover all our endpoints on authorization and response.
