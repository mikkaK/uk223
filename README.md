You'll need a Docker container running **PostgreSQL** on port 5432. 
If you have not already, you can set up such a docker container using the command:

`docker run --name postgres-db -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres`

The username and password are assumed to be both "postgres". 
You can change the username and password that hibernate uses in application.properties.
